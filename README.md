# next-template

Sometimes I feel that I do a lot of things before starting a new project.
Even when I use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), I tend to configuring some aspects of it.
And that **some** soon starts to be a lot of configuration.

So I made this repo as a template for Next.js, well I could use the Next.js Templates but I have my own preferences.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lalit293/next-template.git
```

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install # or use your preferred package manager
```

1. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/)

## Tools (Used In This Template)

This template uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the JS Framework, [BiomeJS](https://biomejs.dev/) as the linter and formatter, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
